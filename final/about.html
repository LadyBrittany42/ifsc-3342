        <p>Greetings!</p>

<p>Welcome to Central Arkansas Pagans and Witches!</p>
<p>This group was founded in 2009 as a way to provide a gathering place for like-minded individuals in the Central Arkansas area to come together to explore themselves, expand their social life, and become more spiritually active. We support all spiritual traditions and paths and we welcome the wisdom and knowledge of all members.</p> 
<p>The way the group works at the moment is this: 
<ul>
<li>The group has regular social gatherings (that are hosted by the organizers) at Noon on every other Saturday. At these gatherings we socialize and discuss various topics over a meal. These gatherings are a way to get to know people in a safe, mutually respectful, and tolerant environment.</li> 
<li>In addition, we have a calendar of events to coordinate group activities. Members are free to just attend but we also encourage fellow members to host their own events (i.e. rituals, classes on specific topics, campouts, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Welcome to the group, and we hope to see you soon!</p>
<p>Brittany and Diane</p>
